# College-Radio-Automation
A simple program that automates the routine tasks of Students for College Radio.


Problem Description:
 The college follows a routine to play National Song - “Vande Matram” before the 1st hour (9:00 am) and National Anthem after the last hour of college (4:30 pm). A group of RJs are assigned the task to follow the timings to play the audio. I, an IT 1st year student, was one of the RJ and realised that such a regularly repeating task can be simply automated to save students’ time which can be used elsewhere for other productive purposes. The automation also includes a college bell which rings according to the college timings. This program solves the problem by automatically playing the audio at given times and also provides a bell to college which is very useful.

Domain: 
System Application, C++ programming language

Functionalities:
By default, the software is designed to do the above mentioned tasks on college working days. For special situations, it is also flexible to change its behaviour by having one of the following options selected:
1.Skipping National Song for the day.
2.Skipping forenoon bells for the day.
3.Skipping afternoon bells for the day.
4.Skipping all bells for the day
5.Skipping the National Anthem for the day.
6.Skipping everything for the day.
When nothing is chosen for the day, by default the songs and bells are played as it must be played on any normal day.
The application runs immediately after the system is switched on.

Dependency:
The target computer in the RJ room must always be running or at least run before 9:00 am for the application to start and run by itself.
